# ML-Project

This is a Face Detection Project finished by Siyi Liu, Yu Du, Bincheng Huang

ML_project.py contains the main function that calls the other functions to do face detection.

LBPH.py contains the code implementing Local Binary Patterns Histogram algorithm.

face_detection.py contains the algorithm performing the face detecting task. 

Despite of these algorithms that we devised and implemented, we also implemented face detection with the help of OpenCV.

The detailed results and the whole algorithms are in our Paper Report, which is in NIPS format.

The more concise and summarized version of report is in Slides Report.
